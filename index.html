                  Ice cream can easily be negatively impacted by temperature
                  change, so it's important to handle it carefully. It is
                  advised to maintain -25 °C room temperature with constant
                  temperature and humidity control. If the cold storage room
                  does not reach -22°C, ice cream will not reach the required
                  hardness and shelf life, which will cause the ice cream to
                  deform and deteriorate.

                  appropriate for the species, type of product and intended time

                  purchase, it should be frozen as soon as possible to preserve
                  optimal quality. Harmful bacteria begin to develop in raw meat
                  from the moment an animal is slaughtered, making storage an
                  incredibly time sensitive process. If you want or need to
                  prolong the life of your meat for as long as possible, it’s
                  crucial that you follow the correct safe storage procedures.
                  Freezing is the most common method of meat preservation. The
                  ideal temperature for the storage of fresh meat is -18°C to
                  -22°C.

                <p>
                  Most fruits and vegetables have a very limited life after
                  harvest if held at ambient harvesting temperatures.
                  Post-harvest cooling rapidly removes field heat, allowing
                  longer storage periods. The low temperatures inside cold
                  storage units halt the growth of these pathogenic fungi,
                  ensuring that spoilage of fruits and vegetables is kept to a
                  minimum. This is why our cold storage units have a varied
                  temperature range for both freezing and chilling options.

                <p>
                  Dried fruit is the fruit from which the majority of the
                  original water content has been removed. Most dry fruits have
                  a limited life after processing if held at normal
                  temperatures. Proper storage in low temperature can reduce
                  respiratory activity and degradation by enzymes and stops
                  production of natural ripening agent i.e. ethylene. In order
                  to maintain vitamin C, storage temperature can be 2°C to 10°C
                  for a storage time of more than a year with a H of 80% to 95%.
